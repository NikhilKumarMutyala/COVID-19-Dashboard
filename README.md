# COVID-19-Dashboard

Created a live dashboard for displaying stats of COVID-19 using Python. Used plotly, ipywidgets, IPython.core, folium to create the dashboard. The dashboard consists of number of confirmed cases, deaths, recovered. It also shows Confirmed/Death/Recovered cases by countries where you can search for any number of countries, Worst Hit Countries and their stats of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered. Finally it consists of world map which shows number of confirmed and death cases for each country when you hover over the country.

In order to view the dashboard, you need to install the <b>Viola</b>. Voilà turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications. Unlike the usual HTML-converted notebooks, each user connecting to the Voilà tornado application gets a dedicated Jupyter kernel which can execute the callbacks to changes in Jupyter interactive widgets.
